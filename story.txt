As the dim light flickered in the interrogation room, Prakash leaned forward, examining Kennedy’s face. It was lined with a mixture of fear and defiance, remnants of a man who had once controlled his destiny. But today, his fate lay in the hands of the authorities. Kennedy’s voice trembled as he recounted the harrowing incident from months ago—the night he had been ambushed, a dark shadow stealing into his life.

“I remember only snippets,” Kennedy began, his eyes darting to the corners of the room as if the assailant might emerge from the shadows. “I was leaving a charity event when it happened. One moment I was getting into my car, and the next, I was blindfolded, my hands tied.” He shuddered, the memory flooding back. “He said he knew me from the 1970s—my past. It felt like he was digging up old graves.”

Prakash and Loganathan exchanged a glance, their skepticism mingling with curiosity. “What did he want from you?” Prakash pressed.

Kennedy inhaled deeply, the tremor in his voice revealing the weight of his confession. “He wanted me to reveal my pressure point attacks—the techniques I’d perfected over the years. He made it clear he had a plan, and I was to help him. He said it was time for me to pay for my past.”

Loganathan, still unconvinced of Kennedy’s innocence regarding the recent murders, leaned in closer. “You expect us to believe that this faceless man was behind the recent killings? What proof do you have?”

“The only thing I remember,” Kennedy said, desperation creeping into his tone, “is the sound of his car. It had this peculiar reverse gear alarm, like a toy rifle firing. It haunts me.”

Prakash scribbled the details down, trying to piece together the puzzle. “And you think this man is connected to the recent murders?”

Kennedy nodded, a flicker of hope igniting in his eyes. “I know he is. But I can’t prove it. And if Freddy finds out who I was, what I did… he’ll never forgive me.”

Loganathan’s expression hardened. “Freddy deserves to know the truth about his father. You can’t hide from your past forever.”

In a sudden burst of emotion, Kennedy sprang to his feet. “No! He can’t know! I won’t let that monster ruin my son’s life!” In a swift motion, he pushed both men from the room, slamming the door shut and locking it.

Panic gripped Prakash as he pounded on the door. “Kennedy! Open up!”

Ignoring their pleas, Kennedy turned on the gas cylinder in the small room, his mind racing with desperation and finality. He knew he was cornered—facing not only his past but the impending reality of his son’s suffering if the truth came out. The thought of Freddy’s innocent face haunted him.

In his final moments, he murmured, “I’m sorry, Freddy. I wanted to protect you.”

With a shaky breath, he struck a match. The ensuing explosion was deafening, consuming the room in a flash of flame and smoke. Prakash and Loganathan were thrown back, the force of the blast echoing down the corridor.

As the dust settled and the sirens wailed in the distance, the full weight of what had transpired settled heavily on Prakash’s shoulders. Kennedy was gone, leaving behind only questions and a tangled web of secrets. In the aftermath, all they could do was confront the haunting legacy of a man who had tried to shield his son from the darkness of his past, even as he surrendered to it.
